## Overview
Added a comprehensive "Show History" feature to the main dashboard that allows users to view their recent analysis history without navigating to a separate page.

## Features Added

### 1. **Collapsible History Section**
- Added a "Show History" button on the main dashboard
- Toggleable section that expands/collapses to show user's analysis history
- Positioned below the card grid for easy access

### 2. **User Statistics Dashboard**
- **Total Analyzed**: Shows total number of articles analyzed by the user

- **Fake News**: Count of articles classified as fake  
- **Average Confidence**: Average confidence score across all analyses

### 3. **Recent Analysis List**

- Each item displays:
  - Prediction result with confidence percentage
  - Article title and preview
  - Analysis date and time
  - Visual badges (✅ for REAL, ❌ for FAKE)

### 4. **User-Specific Data**
- New API endpoint `/api/history` that returns only the logged-in user's data
- Secure access - requires authentication
- Pagination support for large histories

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)
```python
@app.route("/api/history", methods=["GET"])
def get_user_history():
    # Returns user-specific analysis history with statistics
    # Includes pagination and authentication checks
```

### Frontend Changes (`index.html`)
- Added collapsible history section with toggle functionality
- JavaScript functions for loading and displaying history data
- Real-time updates when new analyses are performed
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices

### Key Functions Added:
- `toggleHistory()` - Shows/hides the history section
- `loadHistory()` - Fetches user's history from API
- `displayHistoryStats()` - Shows statistics in grid format
- `displayHistoryList()` - Displays recent analyses list

## User Experience

### Before:
- Users had to navigate to `/history` page to see their analysis history
- No quick overview of their analysis statistics
- Separate page navigation required

### After:
- ✅ Quick access to history directly from main dashboard
- ✅ Statistics overview at a glance
- ✅ Recent analyses visible without page navigation
- ✅ Automatic updates when new analyses are performed
- ✅ Clean, collapsible interface that doesn't clutter the main page

5. **Auto-Update**: History automatically refreshes when you analyze new content

## Security Features
